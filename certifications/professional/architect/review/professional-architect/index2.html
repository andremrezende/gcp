                                     What should you do?</p>
                                 <p>A. Use Spinnaker to deploy builds to production using the red/black deployment strategy so that changes can easily be rolled back.<br/> 
                                    B. Use Spinnaker to deploy builds to production and run tests on production deployments.<br/> 
                                    C. Use Jenkins to build the staging branches and the master branch. Build and deploy changes to production for 10% of users before doing a complete rollout.<br/>
                                    D. Use Jenkins to monitor tags in the repository. Deploy staging tags to a staging environment for testing. After testing, tag the repository for production and deploy that to the production environment.</p>
