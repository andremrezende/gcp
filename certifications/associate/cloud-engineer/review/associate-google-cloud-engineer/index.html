                                            <p>5. You are building an application that processes data files uploaded from thousands of supplier. Your primary goals for the application are data security and the expiration of aged data. You need to design the application to: 
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Restrict access so that suppliers can access only their own data.</li>
                                                    <li>Give supplier write access to data only for 30 minutes</li>
                                                    <li>Delete data that os over 45 days old</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                You have a very short development cycle, and you need to make sure that the application requires minimal maintanace. Which two strategies should you use? (Choose two)
                                            </p>
                                            <p>A. Build a lifecycle policy to delete Cloud Storage objects after 45 days.<br/> 
                                               B. Use signed URLs to allow suppliers limited time access to store their objects.<br/> 
                                               C. Set yp an SFTP server for your application, and create a separate ser for each supplier.<br/> 
                                               D. Build a Cloud function that triggers a timer of 45 has to delete objects that have expired.<br/>
                                               E. Develop a script that loops throug all Cloud Storage buckets and deletes any buckets that are older than 45 days.</p>

Using the same Deployment Manager deployment, you also want to create a DaemonSet in the kube-system namespace of the cluster. You want a solution that uses the fewest possible services. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. Add the cluster's API as a new Type Provider in Deployment Manager, and use the new type to create the DaemonSet.<br/> 
                                               B. Use the Deployment Manager runtime Configurator to create a new Config resource that contains the DaemonSet definition.<br/> 
                                               C. With Deployment Manager, create a Compute Engine instance with a startup script that uses kibeclt to create the DaemonSet.<br/> 
                                               D. In the cluster's definition in Deployment Manager, add a metadata that has kube-system as key and the DaemonSet manifest as value</p>

Each member of this team needs only administrative access to the servers. Your security team wants to ensure that the deployment of credentials is operationally efficient and must be able to determine who accessed a given instance. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A.  Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key in the metadata of each instance.<br/> 
                                               B. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to send you their public key. Use a configuration management tool to deploy those keys on each instance.<br/> 
                                               C. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to add the public key to their Google account. Grant the compute.osAdminLogin role to the Google group corresponding to this team.<br/> 
                                               D. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key as a project-wide public SSH key in your Cloud Platform project and allow project-wide public SSH keys on each instance.</p>

                                            <p>51. You are running an application on multiple virtual machines within a managed instance group and have autoscaling enabled. The autoscaling policy is configured so that additional instances are added to the group if the CPU utilization of instances goes above 80%. VMs are added until the instance group reaches its maximum limit of five VMs or until CPU utilization of instances lowers to 80%. The initial delay for HTTP health checks against the instances is set to 30 seconds.
                                                The virtual machine instances take around three minutes to become available for users. You observe that when the instance group autoscales, it adds more instances then necessary to support the levels of end-user traffic. You want to properly maintain instance group sizes when autoscaling. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. Set the maximum number of instances to 1.<br/>
