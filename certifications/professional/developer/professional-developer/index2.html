											<p>71. Your company is planning to migrate their on-premises Hadoop environment to the cloud. Increasing storage cost and maintenance of data stored in HDFS is a major concern for your company. You also want to make minimal changes to existing data analytics jobs and existing architecture.
                                    How should you proceed with the migration?</p>
                                 <p>A. Migrate your data stored in Hadoop to BigQuery. Change your jobs to source their information from BigQuery instead of the on-premises Hadoop environment.<br/> 
                                    B. Create Compute Engine instances with HDD instead of SSD to save costs. Then perform a full migration of your existing environment into the new one in Compute Engine instances.<br/> 
                                    C. Create a Cloud Dataproc cluster on Google Cloud Platform, and then migrate your Hadoop environment to the new Cloud Dataproc cluster. Move your HDFS data into larger HDD disks to save on storage costs.<br/>
                                    D. Create a Cloud Dataproc cluster on Google Cloud Platform, and then migrate your Hadoop code objects to the new cluster. Move your data to Cloud Storage and leverage the Cloud Dataproc connector to run jobs on that data.</p>

                                    Company Overview -
                                    HipLocal is a community application designed to facilitate communication between people in close proximity. It is used for event planning and organizing sporting events, and for businesses to connect with their local communities. HipLocal launched recently in a few neighborhoods in Dallas and is rapidly growing into a global phenomenon. Its unique style of hyper-local community communication and business outreach is in demand around the world.
                                    
                                    Executive Statement -
                                    We are the number one local community app; it's time to take our local community services global. Our venture capital investors want to see rapid growth and the same great experience for new local and virtual communities that come online, whether their members are 10 or 10000 miles away from each other.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    HipLocal wants to expand their existing service, with updated functionality, in new regions to better serve their global customers. They want to hire and train a new team to support these regions in their time zones. They will need to ensure that the application scales smoothly and provides clear uptime data.
                                    
                                    Existing Technical Environment -
                                    HipLocal's environment is a mix of on-premises hardware and infrastructure running in Google Cloud Platform. The HipLocal team understands their application well, but has limited experience in global scale applications. Their existing technical environment is as follows:
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Existing APIs run on Compute Engine virtual machine instances hosted in GCP.</li>
                                     <li>State is stored in a single instance MySQL database in GCP.</li>
                                     <li>Data is exported to an on-premises Teradata/Vertica data warehouse.</li>
                                     <li>Data analytics is performed in an on-premises Hadoop environment.</li>
                                     <li>The application has no logging.</li>
                                     <li>There are basic indicators of uptime; alerts are frequently fired when the APIs are unresponsive.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    Business Requirements -
                                    HipLocal's investors want to expand their footprint and support the increase in demand they are seeing. Their requirements are:
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Expand availability of the application to new regions.</li>
                                     <li>Increase the number of concurrent users that can be supported.</li>
                                     <li>Ensure a consistent experience for users when they travel to different regions.</li>
                                     <li>Obtain user activity metrics to better understand how to monetize their product.</li>
                                     <li>Ensure compliance with regulations in the new regions (for example, GDPR).</li>
                                     <li>Reduce infrastructure management time and cost.</li>
                                     <li>Adopt the Google-recommended practices for cloud computing.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    Technical Requirements -
                                    <ul>
                                     <li>The application and backend must provide usage metrics and monitoring.</li>
                                     <li>APIs require strong authentication and authorization.</li>
                                     <li>Logging must be increased, and data should be stored in a cloud analytics platform.</li>
                                     <li>Move to serverless architecture to facilitate elastic scaling.</li>
                                     <li>Provide authorized access to internal apps in a secure manner.</li>
                                    </ul>

											<p>86. You are developing an application that will be launched on Compute Engine instances into multiple distinct projects, each corresponding to the environments in your software development process (development, QA, staging, and production). The instances in each project have the same application code but a different configuration. During deployment, each instance should receive the application's configuration based on the environment it serves. You want to minimize the number of steps to configure this flow.

											<p>90. You work for a web development team at a small startup. Your team is developing a Node.js application using Google Cloud services, including Cloud Storage and Cloud Build. The team uses a Git repository for version control. Your manager calls you over the weekend and instructs you to make an emergency update to one of the company's websites, and you're the only developer available. You need to access Google Cloud to make the update, but you don't have your work laptop. You are not allowed to store source code locally on a non-corporate computer. How should you set up your developer environment?
