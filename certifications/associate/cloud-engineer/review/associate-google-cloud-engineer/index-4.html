Some servers should be accessible through the Internet, and other servers should only be accessible over the internal network. All servers need to be able to talk to each other over specific ports and protocols. The current on-premises network relies on a demilitarized zone (DMZ) for the public servers and a Local Area Network (LAN) for the private servers. You need to design the networking infrastructure on

The Apache web server is not the only application running in the project. You want to receive an email when the egress network costs for the server exceed 100 dollars for the current month as measured by Google Cloud.
                                             What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. Set up a budget alert on the project with an amount of 100 dollars, a threshold of 100%, and notification type of email.<br/>

                                               C. Export the billing data to BigQuery. Create a Cloud Function that uses BigQuery to sum the egress network costs of the exported billing data for the Apache web server for the current month and sends an email if it is over 100 dollars. Schedule the Cloud Function using Cloud Scheduler to run hourly.<br/> 
                                               D. Use the Cloud Logging Agent to export the Apache web server logs to Cloud Logging. Create a Cloud Function that uses BigQuery to parse the HTTP response log data in Cloud Logging for the current month and sends an email if the size of all HTTP responses, multiplied by current Google Cloud egress prices, totals over 100 dollars. Schedule the Cloud Function using Cloud Scheduler to run hourly.</p>

You want the Google-recommended solution with the least management overhead and the least number of services. 
                                               What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. 1. Update your instances metadata to add the following value: snapshotschedule: 0 1 * * * 2. Update your instances metadata to add the following value: snapshotretention: 30<br/> 
                                               B. 1. In the Cloud Console, go to the Compute Engine Disks page and select your instance disk. 2. In the Snapshot Schedule section, select Create Schedule and configure the following parameters: - Schedule frequency: Daily - Start time: 1:00 AM  2:00 AM - Autodelete snapshots after: 30 days<br/> 
                                               C. 1. Create a Cloud Function that creates a snapshot of your instance disk. 2. Create a Cloud Function that deletes snapshots that are older than 30 days. 3. Use Cloud Scheduler to trigger both Cloud Functions daily at 1:00 AM.<br/>
                                               D. 1. Create a bash script in the instance that copies the content of the disk to Cloud Storage. 2. Create a bash script in the instance that deletes data older than 30 days in the backup Cloud Storage bucket. 3. Configure the instance crontab to execute these scripts daily at 1:00 AM.

                                                   Cloud Functions can respond to change notifications emerging from Google Cloud Storage. These notifications can be configured to trigger in response to various events inside a bucket—object creation, deletion, archiving and metadata updates.
                                                   
                                                   Note: Cloud Functions can only be triggered by Cloud Storage buckets in the same Google Cloud Platform project.                                                   Event types
                                                   Cloud Storage events used by Cloud Functions are based on Cloud Pub/Sub Notifications for Google Cloud Storage and can be configured in a similar way.                                                   
                                                   Supported trigger type values are:

                                             <ul>
                                                <li>Restrict access so that suppliers can access only their own data.</li>

                                             You have a very short development cycle, and you need to make sure that the application requires minimal maintenance. Which two strategies should you use?(Choose two.)</p>
                                            <p>A. Build a lifecycle policy to delete Cloud Storage objects after 45 days.<br/>

                                               C. Set up an SFTP server for your application, and create a separate user for each supplier.<br/>
                                               D. Build a Cloud function that triggers a timer of 45 days to delete objects that have expired.<br/>
                                               E. Develop a script that loops through all Cloud Storage buckets and deletes any buckets that are older than 45 days.

                                            <p>59. Your company has embraced a hybrid cloud strategy where some of the applications are deployed on Google Cloud. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel connects your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Google Cloud with your company's on-premises network. Multiple applications in Google Cloud need to connect to an on-premises database server, and you want to avoid having to change the IP configuration in all of your applications when the IP of the database changes.
                                             What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. Configure Cloud NAT for all subnets of your VPC to be used when egressing from the VM instances.<br/> 
                                               B. Create a private zone on Cloud DNS, and configure the applications with the DNS name.<br/> 
                                               C. Configure the IP of the database as custom metadata for each instance, and query the metadata server.<br/>
                                               D. Query the Compute Engine internal DNS from the applications to retrieve the IP of the database.</p>
