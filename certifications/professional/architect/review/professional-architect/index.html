However next quarter, your company will be making the portal available to all users, including unauthenticated users. You need to develop a resiliency testing strategy to ensure the system maintains the SLA once they introduce additional user load.
                                    What should you do?</p>
                                 <p>A. Capture existing users input, and replay captured user load until autoscale is triggered on all layers. At the same time, terminate all resources in one of the zones<br/> 
                                    B. Create synthetic random user input, replay synthetic load until autoscale logic is triggered on at least one layer, and introduce ג€chaosג€ to the system by terminating random resources on both zones<br/> 
                                    C. Expose the new system to a larger group of users, and increase group size each day until autoscale logic is triggered on all layers. At the same time, terminate random resources on both zones<br/>
                                    D. Capture existing users input, and replay captured user load until resource utilization crosses 80%. Also, derive estimated number of users based on existing userג€™s usage of the app, and deploy enough resources to handle 200% of expected load</p>

											<p>45. You are building a continuous deployment pipeline for a project stored in a Git source repository and want to ensure that code changes can be verified before deploying to production.
                                     What should you do?</p>
                                 <p>A. Use Spinnaker to deploy builds to production using the red/black deployment strategy so that changes can easily be rolled back.<br/> 
                                    B. Use Spinnaker to deploy builds to production and run tests on production deployments.<br/> 
                                    C. Use Jenkins to build the staging branches and the master branch. Build and deploy changes to production for 10% of users before doing a complete rollout.<br/>
                                    D. Use Jenkins to monitor tags in the repository. Deploy staging tags to a staging environment for testing. After testing, tag the repository for production and deploy that to the production environment.</p>
