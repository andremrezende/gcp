                                    Company Overview -
                                    Mountkirk Games makes online, session-based, multiplayer games for the most popular mobile platforms. They build all of their games using some server-side integration. Historically, they have used cloud providers to lease physical servers.
                                    Due to the unexpected popularity of some of their games, they have had problems scaling their global audience, application servers MySQL databases, and analytics tools.
                                    Their current model is to write game statistics to files and send them through an ETL tool that loads them into a centralized MySQL database for reporting.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    Mountkirk Games is building a new game, which they expect to be very popular. They plan to deploy the game"™s backend on Google Compute Engine so they can capture streaming metrics run intensive analytics, and take advantage of its autoscaling server environment and integrate with a managed NoSQL database.

                                    Increase efficiency of the cloud resources we use
                                    Reduce latency to all customers

                                    Requirements for Game Backend Platform
                                    1. Dynamically scale up or down based on game activity
                                    2. Connect to a managed NoSQL database service
                                    3. Run customize Linux distro
                                    Requirements for Game Analytics Platform
                                    1. Dynamically scale up or down based on game activity
                                    2. Process incoming data on the fly directly from the game servers
                                    3. Process data that arrives late because of slow mobile networks
                                    4. Allow SQL queries to access at least 10 TB of historical data
                                    5. Process files that are regularly uploaded by users"™ mobile devices
                                    6. Use only fully managed services
                                    
                                    CEO Statement -
                                    Our last successful game did not scale well with our previous cloud provider, resulting in lower user adoption and affecting the game"™s reputation. Our investors want more key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the speed and stability of the game, as well as other metrics that provide deeper insight into usage patterns so we can adapt the game to target users.
                                    
                                    CTO Statement -
                                    Our current technology stack cannot provide the scale we need, so we want to replace MySQL and move to an environment that provides autoscaling, low latency load balancing, and frees us up from managing physical servers.
                                    
                                    CFO Statement -
                                    We are not capturing enough user demographic data, usage metrics, and other KPIs. As a result, we do not engage the right users, we are not confident that our marketing is targeting the right users, and we are not selling enough premium Blast-Ups inside the games, which dramatically impacts our revenue.
                                    Question
Mountkirk Games has deployed their new backend on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You want to create a through testing process for new versions of the backend before they are released to the public. You want the testing environment to scale in an economical way. How should you design the process?
                                 </p>

                                    B. Use the existing infrastructure to test the GCP-based backend at scale<br/> 
                                    C. Build stress tests into each component of your application using resources internal to GCP to simulate load<br/>
                                    D. Create a set of static environments in GCP to test different levels of load "" for example, high, medium, and low</p>

                                    Our current technology stack cannot provide the scale we need, so we want to replace MySQL and move to an environment that provides autoscaling, low latency load balancing, and frees us up from managing physical servers.

                                    We are not capturing enough user demographic data, usage metrics, and other KPIs. As a result, we do not engage the right users, we are not confident that our marketing is targeting the right users, and we are not selling enough premium Blast-Ups inside the games, which dramatically impacts our revenue.
                                    Question
                                    Mountkirk Games"™ gaming servers are not automatically scaling properly. Last month, they rolled out a new feature, which suddenly became very popular. A record number of users are trying to use the service, but many of them are getting 503 errors and very slow response times. What should they investigate first?

                                    Mountkirk Games needs to create a repeatable and configurable mechanism for deploying isolated application environments. Developers and testers can access each other"™s environments and resources, but they cannot access staging or production resources. The staging environment needs access to some services from production.
                                    What should you do to isolate development environments from staging and production?

                                    Our last successful game did not scale well with our previous cloud provider, resulting in lower user adoption and affecting the game"™s reputation. Our investors want more key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the speed and stability of the game, as well as other metrics that provide deeper insight into usage patterns so we can adapt the game to target users. Additionally, our current technology stack cannot provide the scale we need, so we want to replace MySQL and move to an environment that provides autoscaling, low latency load balancing, and frees us up from managing physical servers.
                                    Question
                                    For this question, refer to the Mountkirk Games case study. Mountkirk Games wants to migrate from their current analytics and statistics reporting model to one that meets their technical requirements on Google Cloud Platform.
                                    Which two steps should be part of their migration plan? (Choose two.) 
                                    
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Evaluate the impact of migrating their current batch ETL code to Cloud Dataflow.<br/> 
                                    B. Write a schema migration plan to denormalize data for better performance in BigQuery.<br/> 
                                    C. Draw an architecture diagram that shows how to move from a single MySQL database to a MySQL cluster.<br/>
                                    D. Load 10 TB of analytics data from a previous game into a Cloud SQL instance, and run test queries against the full dataset to confirm that they complete successfully.<br/>
                                    E. Integrate Cloud Armor to defend against possible SQL injection attacks in analytics files uploaded to Cloud Storage.</p>

                                    Mountkirk Games makes online, session-based, multiplayer games for mobile platforms. They build all of their games using some server-side integration.
                                    Historically, they have used cloud providers to lease physical servers.
                                    Due to the unexpected popularity of some of their games, they have had problems scaling their global audience, application servers, MySQL databases, and analytics tools.
                                    Their current model is to write game statistics to files and send them through an ETL tool that loads them into a centralized MySQL database for reporting.

Our investors want more key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the speed and stability of the game, as well as other metrics that provide deeper insight into usage patterns so we can adapt the game to target users. Additionally, our current technology stack cannot provide the scale we need, so we want to replace MySQL and move to an environment that provides autoscaling, low latency load balancing, and frees us up from managing physical servers.

                                    Mountkirk Games makes online, session-based, multiplayer games for mobile platforms. They have recently started expanding to other platforms after successfully migrating their on-premises environments to Google Cloud.
                                    Their most recent endeavor is to create a retro-style first-person shooter (FPS) game that allows hundreds of simultaneous players to join a geo-specific digital arena from multiple platforms and locations. A real-time digital banner will display a global leaderboard of all the top players across every active arena.
                                    
                                    Solution concept -
                                    Mountkirk Games is building a new multiplayer game that they expect to be very popular. They plan to deploy the game"™s backend on Google Kubernetes Engine so they can scale rapidly and use Google"™s global load balancer to route players to the closest regional game arenas. In order to keep the global leader board in sync, they plan to use a multi-region Spanner cluster.
                                    
                                    Existing technical environment -
                                    The existing environment was recently migrated to Google Cloud, and five games came across using lift-and-shift virtual machine migrations, with a few minor exceptions.

                                    Our last game was the first time we used Google Cloud, and it was a tremendous success. We were able to analyze player behavior and game telemetry in ways that we never could before. This success allowed us to bet on a full migration to the cloud and to start building all-new games using cloud-native design principles.
                                    Our new game is our most ambitious to date and will open up doors for us to support more gaming platforms beyond mobile. Latency is our top priority, although cost management is the next most important challenge. As with our first cloud-based game, we have grown to expect the cloud to enable advanced analytics capabilities so we can rapidly iterate on our deployments of bug fixes and new functionality.

                                    Mountkirk Games makes online, session-based, multiplayer games for mobile platforms. They have recently started expanding to other platforms after successfully migrating their on-premises environments to Google Cloud.
                                    Their most recent endeavor is to create a retro-style first-person shooter (FPS) game that allows hundreds of simultaneous players to join a geo-specific digital arena from multiple platforms and locations. A real-time digital banner will display a global leaderboard of all the top players across every active arena.
                                    
                                    Solution concept -
                                    Mountkirk Games is building a new multiplayer game that they expect to be very popular. They plan to deploy the game"™s backend on Google Kubernetes Engine so they can scale rapidly and use Google"™s global load balancer to route players to the closest regional game arenas. In order to keep the global leader board in sync, they plan to use a multi-region Spanner cluster.

                                    You are implementing Firestore for Mountkirk Games. Mountkirk Games wants to give a new game programmatic access to a legacy game's Firestore database.
                                    Access should be as restricted as possible. What should you do?</p>
                                 <p>A. Create a service account (SA) in the legacy game"™s Google Cloud project, add a second SA in the new game"™s IAM page, and then give the Organization Admin role to both SAs.<br/> 
                                    B. Create a service account (SA) in the legacy game"™s Google Cloud project, give the SA the Organization Admin role, and then give it the Firebase Admin role in both projects.<br/> 
                                    C. Create a service account (SA) in the legacy game"™s Google Cloud project, add this SA in the new game"™s IAM page, and then give it the Firebase Admin role in both projects.<br/>
                                    D. Create a service account (SA) in the legacy game"™s Google Cloud project, give it the Firebase Admin role, and then migrate the new game to the legacy game"™s project.</p>

                                    Company overview -
                                    Mountkirk Games makes online, session-based, multiplayer games for mobile platforms. They have recently started expanding to other platforms after successfully migrating their on-premises environments to Google Cloud.
                                    Their most recent endeavor is to create a retro-style first-person shooter (FPS) game that allows hundreds of simultaneous players to join a geo-specific digital arena from multiple platforms and locations. A real-time digital banner will display a global leaderboard of all the top players across every active arena.
                                    
                                    Solution concept -
                                    Mountkirk Games is building a new multiplayer game that they expect to be very popular. They plan to deploy the game"™s backend on Google Kubernetes Engine so they can scale rapidly and use Google"™s global load balancer to route players to the closest regional game arenas. In order to keep the global leader board in sync, they plan to use a multi-region Spanner cluster.
                                    
                                    Existing technical environment -
                                    The existing environment was recently migrated to Google Cloud, and five games came across using lift-and-shift virtual machine migrations, with a few minor exceptions. Each new game exists in an isolated Google Cloud project nested below a folder that maintains most of the permissions and network policies. Legacy games with low traffic have been consolidated into a single project. There are also separate environments for development and testing.

                                    Executive statement -
                                    Our last game was the first time we used Google Cloud, and it was a tremendous success. We were able to analyze player behavior and game telemetry in ways that we never could before. This success allowed us to bet on a full migration to the cloud and to start building all-new games using cloud-native design principles.
                                    Our new game is our most ambitious to date and will open up doors for us to support more gaming platforms beyond mobile. Latency is our top priority, although cost management is the next most important challenge. As with our first cloud-based game, we have grown to expect the cloud to enable advanced analytics capabilities so we can rapidly iterate on our deployments of bug fixes and new functionality.

                                    There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
                                    Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.
                                    
                                    Existing Technical Environment -

                                    TerramEarth"™s existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via
                                    FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
                                    With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.

                                    Business Requirements -
                                    Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus inventory
                                    Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services
                                    Have the ability to partner with different companies "" especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business "" to create compelling joint offerings for their customers.

                                    CEO Statement -
                                    We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly, and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers"™ yields by 25%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.

                                    CTO Statement -
                                    Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I"™m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn"™t take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.
                                    Question
                                    TerramEarth"™s CTO wants to use the raw data from connected vehicles to help identify approximately when a vehicle in the field will have a catastrophic failure.
                                    You want to allow analysts to centrally query the vehicle data.
                                    Which architecture should you recommend?

                                    TerramEarth"™s existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via
                                    FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
                                    With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.

                                    Business Requirements -
                                    Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus inventory
                                    Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services
                                    Have the ability to partner with different companies "" especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business "" to create compelling joint offerings for their customers.

                                    CEO Statement -
                                    We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly, and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers"™ yields by 25%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.

                                    CTO Statement -
                                    Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I"™m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn"™t take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.

                                    TerramEarth plans to connect all 20 million vehicles in the field to the cloud. This increases the volume to 20 million 600 byte records a second for 40 TB an hour.

                                    Company Overview -
                                    TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: about 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
                                    
                                    Company background -
                                    TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.
                                    TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers"™ needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
                                    Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.

                                    We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly, and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers"™ yields by 25%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.
                                    
                                    CTO Statement -
                                    Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I"™m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn"™t take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.
                                    Question
                                    To speed up data retrieval, more vehicles will be upgraded to cellular connections and be able to transmit data to the ETL process. The current FTP process is error-prone and restarts the data transfer from the start of the file when connections fail, which happens often. You want to improve the reliability of the solution and minimize data transfer time on the cellular connections.
                                    What should you do?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Use one Google Container Engine cluster of FTP servers. Save the data to a Multi-Regional bucket. Run the ETL process using data in the bucket<br/> 
                                    B. Use multiple Google Container Engine clusters running FTP servers located in different regions. Save the data to Multi-Regional buckets in US, EU, and Asia. Run the ETL process using the data in the bucket<br/> 
                                    C. Directly transfer the files to different Google Cloud Multi-Regional Storage bucket locations in US, EU, and Asia using Google APIs over HTTP(S). Run the ETL process using the data in the bucket<br/>
                                    D. Directly transfer the files to a different Google Cloud Regional Storage bucket location in US, EU, and Asia using Google APIs over HTTP(S). Run the ETL process to retrieve the data from each Regional bucket</p>

                                    Company Overview -
                                    TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: about 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
                                    
                                    Company background -
                                    TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.
                                    TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers"™ needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
                                    Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.

                                    TerramEarth"™s existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via
                                    FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
                                    With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.

                                    We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly, and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers"™ yields by 25%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.
                                    
                                    CTO Statement -
                                    Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I"™m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn"™t take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.
                                    Question

                                    Company Overview -
                                    TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: about 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
                                    
                                    Company background -
                                    TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.
                                    TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers"™ needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
                                    Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.
                                    
                                    Existing Technical Environment -

                                    TerramEarth"™s existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via
                                    FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
                                    With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.

                                    Operational parameters such as oil pressure are adjustable on each of TerramEarth"™s vehicles to increase their efficiency, depending on their environmental conditions. Your primary goal is to increase the operating efficiency of all 20 million cellular and unconnected vehicles in the field.
                                    How can you accomplish this goal?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Have you engineers inspect the data for patterns, and then create an algorithm with rules that make operational adjustments automatically<br/> 
                                    B. Capture all operating data, train machine learning models that identify ideal operations, and run locally to make operational adjustments automatically<br/> 
                                    C. Implement a Google Cloud Dataflow streaming job with a sliding window, and use Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) to make operational adjustments automatically<br/>

                                    CEO Statement -
                                    We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly, and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers"™ yields by 25%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.
                                    
                                    CTO Statement -
                                    Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I"™m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn"™t take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.

                                    Company Overview -
                                    TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: about 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
                                    
                                    Company background -
                                    TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.
                                    TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers"™ needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
                                    Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.

                                    TerramEarth"™s existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via
                                    FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
                                    With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.

These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.
                                    
                                    CTO Statement -
                                    Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I"™m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn"™t take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.

                                    Company Overview -
                                    TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: about 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
                                    
                                    Company background -
                                    TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.
                                    TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers"™ needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
                                    Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.
                                    
                                    Existing Technical Environment -

                                    TerramEarth"™s existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via
                                    FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
                                    With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.
                                    
                                    Business Requirements -
                                    Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus inventory
                                    Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services
                                    Have the ability to partner with different companies "" especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business "" to create compelling joint offerings for their customers.

                                    Question
                                    To speed up data retrieval, more vehicles will be upgraded to cellular connections and be able to transmit data to the ETL process. The current FTP process is error-prone and restarts the data transfer from the start of the file when connections fail, which happens often. You want to improve the reliability of the solution and minimize data transfer time on the cellular connections.
                                    What should you do?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Use one Google Container Engine cluster of FTP servers. Save the data to a Multi-Regional bucket. Run the ETL process using data in the bucket<br/> 
                                    B. Use multiple Google Container Engine clusters running FTP servers located in different regions. Save the data to Multi-Regional buckets in US, EU, and Asia. Run the ETL process using the data in the bucket<br/> 
                                    C. Directly transfer the files to different Google Cloud Multi-Regional Storage bucket locations in US, EU, and Asia using Google APIs over HTTP(S). Run the ETL process using the data in the bucket<br/>

Unfortunately, our CEO doesn"™t take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.
                                    Question
                                    TerramEarth has equipped all connected trucks with servers and sensors to collect telemetry data. Next year they want to use the data to train machine learning models. They want to store this data in the cloud while reducing costs.
                                    What should they do?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Have the vehicle"™s computer compress the data in hourly snapshots, and store it in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Nearline bucket<br/> 
                                    B. Push the telemetry data in real-time to a streaming dataflow job that compresses the data, and store it in Google BigQuery<br/> 
                                    C. Push the telemetry data in real-time to a streaming dataflow job that compresses the data, and store it in Cloud Bigtable<br/>
                                    D. Have the vehicle"™s computer compress the data in hourly snapshots, and store it in a GCS Coldline bucket</p>

                                    Company Overview -
                                    TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: about 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
                                    
                                    Company background -
                                    TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.
                                    TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers"™ needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
                                    Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.
                                    
                                    Existing Technical Environment -
                                    <img src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04136/0002400001.png">
                                    TerramEarth"™s existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via
                                    FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
                                    With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.
                                    
                                    Business Requirements -
                                    Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus inventory
                                    Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services
                                    Have the ability to partner with different companies "" especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business "" to create compelling joint offerings for their customers.
                                    
                                    CEO Statement -
                                    We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly, and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers"™ yields by 25%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.
                                    
                                    CTO Statement -

                                    Our competitive advantage has always been in our manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I"™m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.
                                    Question
                                    For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. To be compliant with European GDPR regulation, TerramEarth is required to delete data generated from its
                                    European customers after a period of 36 months when it contains personal data. In the new architecture, this data will be stored in both Cloud Storage and
                                    BigQuery. What should you do?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Create a BigQuery table for the European data, and set the table retention period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to enable lifecycle management using a DELETE action with an Age condition of 36 months.<br/> 
                                    B. Create a BigQuery table for the European data, and set the table retention period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to create a SetStorageClass to NONE action when with an Age condition of 36 months.<br/> 
                                    C. Create a BigQuery time-partitioned table for the European data, and set the partition expiration period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to enable lifecycle management using a DELETE action with an Age condition of 36 months.<br/>
                                    D. Create a BigQuery time-partitioned table for the European data, and set the partition expiration period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to create a SetStorageClass to NONE action with an Age condition of 36 months.</p>

											<p>242. Introductory Info
                                    Company Overview -
                                    TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries. About 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
                                    Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second, with
                                    22 hours of operation per day, TerramEarth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.
                                    
                                    Existing Technical Environment -
                                    TerramEarth"™s existing architecture is composed of Linux and Windows-based systems that reside in a single U.S, west coast based data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
                                    With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.
                                    
                                    Business Requirements -
                                    Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week
                                    Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services
                                    Have the ability to partner with different companies "" especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business "" to create compelling joint offerings for their customers

											<p>244. Introductory Info
                                    Company Overview -
                                    TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries. About 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
                                    Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second, with
                                    22 hours of operation per day, TerramEarth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.
                                    
                                    Existing Technical Environment -
                                    TerramEarth"™s existing architecture is composed of Linux and Windows-based systems that reside in a single U.S, west coast based data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
                                    With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.
                                    
                                    Business Requirements -
                                    Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week
                                    Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services
                                    Have the ability to partner with different companies "" especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business "" to create compelling joint offerings for their customers
                                    
                                    Technical Requirements -
                                    Expand beyond a single datacenter to decrease latency to the American midwest and east coast
                                    Create a backup strategy
                                    Increase security of data transfer from equipment to the datacenter
                                    Improve data in the data warehouse
                                    Use customer and equipment data to anticipate customer needs
                                    
                                    Application 1: Data ingest -
                                    A custom Python application reads uploaded datafiles from a single server, writes to the data warehouse.
                                    Compute:
                                    Windows Server 2008 R2
                                    - 16 CPUs

                                    - 10 TB local HDD storage
                                    
                                    Application 2: Reporting -
                                    An off the shelf application that business analysts use to run a daily report to see what equipment needs repair. Only 2 analysts of a team of 10 (5 west coast, 5 east coast) can connect to the reporting application at a time.
                                    Compute:

                                    Executive Statement -
                                    Our competitive advantage has always been in our manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I"™m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.
                                    Question
                                    For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. A new architecture that writes all incoming data to BigQuery has been introduced. You notice that the data is dirty, and want to ensure data quality on an automated daily basis while managing cost.
                                    What should you do?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Set up a streaming Cloud Dataflow job, receiving data by the ingestion process. Clean the data in a Cloud Dataflow pipeline.<br/> 
                                    B. Create a Cloud Function that reads data from BigQuery and cleans it. Trigger the Cloud Function from a Compute Engine instance.<br/> 
                                    C. Create a SQL statement on the data in BigQuery, and save it as a view. Run the view daily, and save the result to a new table.<br/>
                                    D. Use Cloud Dataprep and configure the BigQuery tables as the source. Schedule a daily job to clean the data.</p>

                                    Question
                                    For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. You start to build a new application that uses a few Cloud Functions for the backend. One use case requires a Cloud Function func_display to invoke another Cloud Function func_query. You want func_query only to accept invocations from func_display. You also want to follow Google's recommended best practices. What should you do?                                    
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Create a token and pass it in as an environment variable to func_display. When invoking func_query, include the token in the request. Pass the same token to func_query and reject the invocation if the tokens are different.<br/> 
                                    B. Make func_query 'Require authentication.' Create a unique service account and associate it to func_display. Grant the service account invoker role for func_query. Create an id token in func_display and include the token to the request when invoking func_query.<br/> 
                                    C. Make func_query 'Require authentication' and only accept internal traffic. Create those two functions in the same VPC. Create an ingress firewall rule for func_query to only allow traffic from func_display.<br/>
                                    D. Create those two functions in the same project and VPC. Make func_query only accept internal traffic. Create an ingress firewall for func_query to only allow traffic from func_display. Also, make sure both functions use the same service account.</p>

The rest of the sensor data is collected, compressed, and uploaded daily when the vehicles return to home base. Each vehicle usually generates 200 to 500 megabytes of data per day.

                                    TerramEarth's vehicle data aggregation and analysis infrastructure resides in Google Cloud and serves clients from all around the world. A growing amount of sensor data is captured from their two main manufacturing plants and sent to private data centers that contain their legacy inventory and logistics management systems. The private data centers have multiple network interconnects configured to Google Cloud. The web frontend for dealers and customers is running in
                                    Google Cloud and allows access to stock management and analytics.

                                    Question
                                    For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. TerramEarth has a legacy web application that you cannot migrate to cloud. However, you still want to build a cloud-native way to monitor the application. If the application goes down, you want the URL to point to a "Site is unavailable" page as soon as possible. You also want your Ops team to receive a notification for the issue. You need to build a reliable solution for minimum cost. What should you do?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Create a scheduled job in Cloud Run to invoke a container every minute. The container will check the application URL. If the application is down, switch the URL to the "Site is unavailable" page, and notify the Ops team.<br/> 
                                    B. Create a cron job on a Compute Engine VM that runs every minute. The cron job invokes a Python program to check the application URL. If the application is down, switch the URL to the "Site is unavailable" page, and notify the Ops team.<br/> 
                                    C. Create a Cloud Monitoring uptime check to validate the application URL. If it fails, put a message in a Pub/Sub queue that triggers a Cloud Function to switch the URL to the "Site is unavailable" page, and notify the Ops team.<br/>
                                    D. Use Cloud Error Reporting to check the application URL. If the application is down, switch the URL to the "Site is unavailable" page, and notify the Ops team.</p>
