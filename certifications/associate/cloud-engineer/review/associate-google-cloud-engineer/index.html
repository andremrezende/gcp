                                            <p>5. You are building an application that processes data files uploaded from thousands of supplier. Your primary goals for the application are data security and the expiration of aged data. You need to design the application to: 
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Restrict access so that suppliers can access only their own data.</li>
                                                    <li>Give supplier write access to data only for 30 minutes</li>
                                                    <li>Delete data that os over 45 days old</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                You have a very short development cycle, and you need to make sure that the application requires minimal maintanace. Which two strategies should you use? (Choose two)
                                            </p>
                                            <p>A. Build a lifecycle policy to delete Cloud Storage objects after 45 days.<br/> 
                                               B. Use signed URLs to allow suppliers limited time access to store their objects.<br/> 
                                               C. Set yp an SFTP server for your application, and create a separate ser for each supplier.<br/> 
                                               D. Build a Cloud function that triggers a timer of 45 das to delete objects that have expired.<br/>
                                               E. Develop a script that loops throug all Cloud Storage buckets and deletes any buckets that are older than 45 days.</p>

                                            <p>7. You are using Deployment Manager to create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster. Using the same Deployment Manager dployment, you also want to create a DaemonSet in the kube-system namespace of the cluster. You want a solution that uses the fewest possible services. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. Add the cluster's API as a new Type Provider in Deployment Manager, and use the new type to create the DaemonSet.<br/> 
                                               B. Use the Deployment Manager runtime Configurator to create a new Config resource that contains the DaemonSet definition.<br/> 
                                               C. With Deployment Manager, create a Compute Engine instance with a startup script that uses kibeclt to create the DaemonSet.<br/> 
                                               D. In the cluster's definition in Deployment Manager, add a metadata that has kube-system as key and the DaemonSet manifest as value</p>

The primary table is write-heavy, whereas the GSI is used for read operations. Looking at Amazon CloudWatch metrics, the Developer notices that write operations to the primary table are throttled frequently under heavy write activity. However, write capacity units to the primary table are available and not fully consumed. Why is the table being throttled?</p>
                                            <p>A. The GSI write capacity units are under provisioned<br/> B. There are not enough read capacity units on the primary table<br/> C.

When an update on table affects Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs), provisioned throughput will be consumed on both table and the affected GSIs. When one or more GSIs cannot keep up with the updates from table, all write requests to the table will be throttled. Because the throttle is due to back pressure from GSI, the throttle reason is GSI back pressure.
Note that all write requests will be throttled when there is GSI back pressure. That means even if the write request doesn't affect any GSI.</p></div>

                                            <p>A. Manually reduce the concurrent execution limit at the account level<br/> B. Add another API Gateway stage for /MyAPI, and shard the requests<br/> C. Configure the second Lambda functions concurrency execution limit<br/> D. Reduce the throttling limits in the API Gateway /MyAPI endpoint</p>

													<p>
													In the AWS Lambda resource model, you choose the amount of memory you want for your function, and are allocated proportional CPU power and other resources. For example, choosing 256MB of memory allocates approximately twice as much CPU power to your Lambda function as requesting 128MB of memory and half as much CPU power as choosing 512MB of memory. To learn more, see our Function Configuration documentation.
You can set your memory in 64MB increments from 128MB to 3GB.

													<p>
														We are talking about 3 strong reads of 7KB. 7KB requires 2 RCUs, so 3 x 2 = 6. Regarding the writes, we are talking about 10 itens per second. 7KB requires 7 WCUs. So 10 x 7 = 70.
