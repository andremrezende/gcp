                                            <p>8. You have an application running in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with cluster autoscaling enabled. The application exposes a TCP endpoint. There are several replicas of this application. You have a Compute Engine instance in the same region, but in another Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), called gce-network, that has no overlapping IP ranges with the first VPC. This instance needs to connect to the application on GKE. You want to minimize effort. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type LoadBalancer that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2.

                                               B. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type NodePort that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2. Create a Compute Engine instance called proxy with 2 network interfaces, one in each VPC. 3. Use iptables on this instance to forward traffic from gce-network to the GKE nodes. 4. Configure the Compute Engine instance to use the address of proxy in gce-network as endpoint.<br/> 
                                               C. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type LoadBalancer that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2. Add an annotation to this service: cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: Internal 3. Peer the two VPCs together. 4. Configure the Compute Engine instance to use the address of the load balancer that has been created.<br/> 
                                               D. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type LoadBalancer that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2. Add a Cloud Armor Security Policy to the load balancer that whitelists the internal IPs of the MIG's instances. 3. Configure the Compute Engine instance to use the address of the load balancer that has been created.</p>

However, security policies prevent the servers hosting the application from having public IP addresses or access to the internet. You want to follow Google-recommended practices to provide the application with access to Cloud Storage. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. 1. Use nslookup to get the IP address for storage.googleapis.com. 2. Negotiate with the security team to be able to give a public IP address to the servers. 3. Only allow egress traffic from those servers to the IP addresses for storage.googleapis.com.<br/>

You have already installed the Cloud Logging agent on all the instances. You want to minimize cost. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. 1. Give the BigQuery Data Editor role on the platform-logs dataset to the service accounts used by your instances. 2. Update your instancesג€™ metadata to add the following value: logs-destination: bq://platform-logs.<br/>
                                               B. 1. In Cloud Logging, create a logs export with a Cloud Pub/Sub topic called logs as a sink. 2. Create a Cloud Function that is triggered by messages in the logs topic. 3. Configure that Cloud Function to drop logs that are not from Compute Engine and to insert Compute Engine logs in the platform-logs dataset.<br/>
                                               C. 1. In Cloud Logging, create a filter to view only Compute Engine logs. 2. Click Create Export. 3. Choose BigQuery as Sink Service, and the platform-logs dataset as Sink Destination.<br/> 
                                               D. 1. Create a Cloud Function that has the BigQuery User role on the platform-logs dataset. 2. Configure this Cloud Function to create a BigQuery Job that executes this query: INSERT INTO dataset.platform-logs (timestamp, log) SELECT timestamp, log FROM compute.logs WHERE timestamp > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY) 3. Use Cloud Scheduler to trigger this Cloud Function once a day.</p>

                                            <p>A. Store the database password inside the Docker image of the container, not in the YAML file.<br/>
                                               B. Store the database password inside a Secret object. Modify the YAML file to populate the DB_PASSWORD environment variable from the Secret.<br/> 
                                               C. Store the database password inside a ConfigMap object. Modify the YAML file to populate the DB_PASSWORD environment variable from the ConfigMap.<br/>

                                            <p>51. You are running an application on multiple virtual machines within a managed instance group and have autoscaling enabled. The autoscaling policy is configured so that additional instances are added to the group if the CPU utilization of instances goes above 80%. VMs are added until the instance group reaches its maximum limit of five VMs or until CPU utilization of instances lowers to 80%. The initial delay for HTTP health checks against the instances is set to 30 seconds.
                                                The virtual machine instances take around three minutes to become available for users. You observe that when the instance group autoscales, it adds more instances then necessary to support the levels of end-user traffic. You want to properly maintain instance group sizes when autoscaling. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. Set the maximum number of instances to 1.<br/>
                                               B. Decrease the maximum number of instances to 3.<br/> 
                                               C. Use a TCP health check instead of an HTTP health check.<br/> 
                                               D. Increase the initial delay of the HTTP health check to 200 seconds.</p>
