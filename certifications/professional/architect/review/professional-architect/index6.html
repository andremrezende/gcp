											<p>251. Introductory Info
                                    Company overview -
                                    TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries.
                                    Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
                                    
                                    Solution concept -
                                    There are 2 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation currently, and we see 20% yearly growth. Vehicles collect telemetry data from many sensors during operation. A small subset of critical data is transmitted from the vehicles in real time to facilitate fleet management. The rest of the sensor data is collected, compressed, and uploaded daily when the vehicles return to home base. Each vehicle usually generates 200 to 500 megabytes of data per day.
                                    
                                    Existing technical environment -
                                    TerramEarth's vehicle data aggregation and analysis infrastructure resides in Google Cloud and serves clients from all around the world. A growing amount of sensor data is captured from their two main manufacturing plants and sent to private data centers that contain their legacy inventory and logistics management systems. The private data centers have multiple network interconnects configured to Google Cloud. The web frontend for dealers and customers is running in
                                    Google Cloud and allows access to stock management and analytics.
                                    
                                    Business requirements -
                                    "¢ Predict and detect vehicle malfunction and rapidly ship parts to dealerships for just-in-time repair where possible.
                                    "¢ Decrease cloud operational costs and adapt to seasonality.
                                    "¢ Increase speed and reliability of development workflow.

                                    "¢ Use cloud-native solutions for keys and secrets management and optimize for identity-based access.
                                    "¢ Improve and standardize tools necessary for application and network monitoring and troubleshooting.
                                    
                                    Executive statement -
                                    Our competitive advantage has always been our focus on the customer, with our ability to provide excellent customer service and minimize vehicle downtimes.
                                    After moving multiple systems into Google Cloud, we are seeking new ways to provide best-in-class online fleet management services to our customers and improve operations of our dealerships. Our 5-year strategic plan is to create a partner ecosystem of new products by enabling access to our data, increasing autonomous operation capabilities of our vehicles, and creating a path to move the remaining legacy systems to the cloud.
                                    Question
                                    For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. You are building a microservice-based application for TerramEarth. The application is based on Docker containers. You want to follow Google-recommended practices to build the application continuously and store the build artifacts. What should you do?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Configure a trigger in Cloud Build for new source changes. Invoke Cloud Build to build container images for each microservice, and tag them using the code commit hash. Push the images to the Container Registry.<br/> 
                                    B. Configure a trigger in Cloud Build for new source changes. The trigger invokes build jobs and build container images for the microservices. Tag the images with a version number, and push them to Cloud Storage.<br/> 
                                    C. Create a Scheduler job to check the repo every minute. For any new change, invoke Cloud Build to build container images for the microservices. Tag the images using the current timestamp, and push them to the Container Registry.<br/>
                                    D. Configure a trigger in Cloud Build for new source changes. Invoke Cloud Build to build one container image, and tag the image with the label 'latest.' Push the image to the Container Registry.</p>

                                    For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. TerramEarth has about 1 petabyte (PB) of vehicle testing data in a private data center. You want to move the data to Cloud Storage for your machine learning team. Currently, a 1-Gbps interconnect link is available for you. The machine learning team wants to start using the data in a month. What should you do?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Request Transfer Appliances from Google Cloud, export the data to appliances, and return the appliances to Google Cloud.<br/> 
                                    B. Configure the Storage Transfer service from Google Cloud to send the data from your data center to Cloud Storage.<br/> 
                                    C. Make sure there are no other users consuming the 1Gbps link, and use multi-thread transfer to upload the data to Cloud Storage.<br/>
                                    D. Export files to an encrypted USB device, send the device to Google Cloud, and request an import of the data to Cloud Storage.</p>

											<p>253. Introductory Info
                                    Company Overview -
                                    Dress4Win is a web-based company that helps their users organize and manage their personal wardrobe using a website and mobile application. The company also cultivates an active social network that connects their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through advertising, e-commerce, referrals, and a premium app model.
                                    
                                    Company Background -
                                    Dress4Win"™s application has grown from a few servers in the founder"™s garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a collocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insufficient for the application"™s rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company"™s desire to innovate faster,
                                    Dress4Win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    For the first phase of their migration to the cloud, Dress4Win is considering moving their development and test environments. They are also considering building a disaster recovery site, because their current infrastructure is at a single location. They are not sure which components of their architecture they can migrate as is and which components they need to change before migrating them.
                                    
                                    Existing Technical Environment -
                                    The Dress4Win application is served out of a single data center location.
                                    Databases:
                                    - MySQL - user data, inventory, static data
                                    - Redis - metadata, social graph, caching
                                    Application servers:
                                    - Tomcat - Java micro-services

                                    Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a new competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and freeing them to focus on developing better features.
                                    
                                    CTO Statement -
                                    We have invested heavily in the current infrastructure, but much of the equipment is approaching the end of its useful life. We are consistently waiting weeks for new gear to be racked before we can start new projects. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.

                                    Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years puts a cloud strategy between 30 to 50% lower than our current model.
                                    Question
                                    The Dress4Win security team has disabled external SSH access into production virtual machines (VMs) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
                                    The operations team needs to remotely manage the VMs, build and push Docker containers, and manage Google Cloud Storage objects.
                                    What can they do?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Grant the operations engineer access to use Google Cloud Shell.<br/> 
                                    B. Configure a VPN connection to GCP to allow SSH access to the cloud VMs.<br/> 
                                    C. Develop a new access request process that grants temporary SSH access to cloud VMs when an operations engineer needs to perform a task.<br/>
                                    D. Have the development team build an API service that allows the operations team to execute specific remote procedure calls to accomplish their tasks.</p>

                                    Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure.

                                    CTO Statement -
                                    We have invested heavily in the current infrastructure, but much of the equipment is approaching the end of its useful life. We are consistently waiting weeks for new gear to be racked before we can start new projects. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.
                                    
                                    CFO Statement -
                                    Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years puts a cloud strategy between 30 to 50% lower than our current model.
                                    Question
                                    Dress4Win has asked you to recommend machine types they should deploy their application servers to.
                                    How should you proceed?                              
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Perform a mapping of the on-premises physical hardware cores and RAM to the nearest machine types in the cloud.<br/> 
                                    B. Recommend that Dress4Win deploy application servers to machine types that offer the highest RAM to CPU ratio available.<br/> 
                                    C. Recommend that Dress4Win deploy into production with the smallest instances available, monitor them over time, and scale the machine type up until the desired performance is reached.<br/>
                                    D. Identify the number of virtual cores and RAM associated with the application server virtual machines align them to a custom machine type in the cloud, monitor performance, and scale the machine types up until the desired performance is reached.</p>

                                    As part of Dress4Win's plans to migrate to the cloud, they want to be able to set up a managed logging and monitoring system so they can handle spikes in their traffic load.
                                    They want to ensure that:
                                    * The infrastructure can be notified when it needs to scale up and down to handle the ebb and flow of usage throughout the day
                                    * Their administrators are notified automatically when their application reports errors.
                                    * They can filter their aggregated logs down in order to debug one piece of the application across many hosts
                                    Which Google StackDriver features should they use?

                                    CTO Statement -
                                    We have invested heavily in the current infrastructure, but much of the equipment is approaching the end of its useful life. We are consistently waiting weeks for new gear to be racked before we can start new projects. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.
                                    
                                    CFO Statement -
                                    Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years puts a cloud strategy between 30 to 50% lower than our current model.
                                    Question
                                    Dress4Win would like to become familiar with deploying applications to the cloud by successfully deploying some applications quickly, as is. They have asked for your recommendation.
                                    What should you advise?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Identify self-contained applications with external dependencies as a first move to the cloud.<br/> 
                                    B. Identify enterprise applications with internal dependencies and recommend these as a first move to the cloud.<br/> 
                                    C. Suggest moving their in-house databases to the cloud and continue serving requests to on-premise applications.<br/>
                                    D. Recommend moving their message queuing servers to the cloud and continue handling requests to on-premise applications.</p>

                                    Dress4Win has asked you for advice on how to migrate their on-premises MySQL deployment to the cloud.
                                    They want to minimize downtime and performance impact to their on-premises solution during the migration.
                                    Which approach should you recommend?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Create a dump of the on-premises MySQL master server, and then shut it down, upload it to the cloud environment, and load into a new MySQL cluster.<br/> 
                                    B. Setup a MySQL replica server/slave in the cloud environment, and configure it for asynchronous replication from the MySQL master server on-premises until cutover.<br/> 
                                    C. Create a new MySQL cluster in the cloud, configure applications to begin writing to both on premises and cloud MySQL masters, and destroy the original cluster at cutover.<br/>
                                    D. Create a dump of the MySQL replica server into the cloud environment, load it into: Google Cloud Datastore, and configure applications to read/write to Cloud Datastore at cutover.</p>

                                    Dress4Win has configured a new uptime check with Google Stackdriver for several of their legacy services. The Stackdriver dashboard is not reporting the services as healthy.
                                    What should they do?
                                    </p>
                                 <p>A. Install the Stackdriver agent on all of the legacy web servers.<br/> 
                                    B. In the Cloud Platform Console download the list of the uptime servers' IP addresses and create an inbound firewall rule<br/>

                                    Company Overview -
                                    Dress4Win is a web-based company that helps their users organize and manage their personal wardrobe using a website and mobile application. The company also cultivates an active social network that connects their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through advertising, e-commerce, referrals, and a premium app model.
                                    
                                    Company Background -
                                    Dress4Win"™s application has grown from a few servers in the founder"™s garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a collocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insufficient for the application"™s rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company"™s desire to innovate faster,
                                    Dress4Win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    For the first phase of their migration to the cloud, Dress4Win is considering moving their development and test environments. They are also considering building a disaster recovery site, because their current infrastructure is at a single location. They are not sure which components of their architecture they can migrate as is and which components they need to change before migrating them.
                                    
                                    Existing Technical Environment -
                                    The Dress4Win application is served out of a single data center location.

                                    CEO Statement -
                                    Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a new competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and freeing them to focus on developing better features.
                                    
                                    CTO Statement -
                                    We have invested heavily in the current infrastructure, but much of the equipment is approaching the end of its useful life. We are consistently waiting weeks for new gear to be racked before we can start new projects. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.
                                    
                                    CFO Statement -
                                    Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years puts a cloud strategy between 30 to 50% lower than our current model.
                                    Question
                                    As part of their new application experience, Dress4Wm allows customers to upload images of themselves.
                                    The customer has exclusive control over who may view these images.
                                    Customers should be able to upload images with minimal latency and also be shown their images quickly on the main application page when they log in.
                                    Which configuration should Dress4Win use?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Store image files in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Use Google Cloud Datastore to maintain metadata that maps each customer's ID and their image files.<br/> 
                                    B. Store image files in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Add custom metadata to the uploaded images in Cloud Storage that contains the customer's unique ID.<br/> 
                                    C. Use a distributed file system to store customers' images. As storage needs increase, add more persistent disks and/or nodes. Assign each customer a unique ID, which sets each file's owner attribute, ensuring privacy of images.<br/>
                                    D. Use a distributed file system to store customers' images. As storage needs increase, add more persistent disks and/or nodes. Use a Google Cloud SQL database to maintain metadata that maps each customer's ID to their image files.</p>

                                    Question
                                    Dress4Win has end-to-end tests covering 100% of their endpoints.
                                    They want to ensure that the move to the cloud does not introduce any new bugs.
                                    Which additional testing methods should the developers employ to prevent an outage?                                    
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. They should enable Google Stackdriver Debugger on the application code to show errors in the code.<br/> 
                                    B. They should add additional unit tests and production scale load tests on their cloud staging environment.<br/> 
                                    C. They should run the end-to-end tests in the cloud staging environment to determine if the code is working as intended.<br/>
                                    D. They should add canary tests so developers can measure how much of an impact the new release causes to latency.</p>

                                    Dress4Win"™s application has grown from a few servers in the founder"™s garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a collocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insufficient for the application"™s rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company"™s desire to innovate faster,
                                    Dress4Win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud.

                                    CEO Statement -
                                    Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a new competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and freeing them to focus on developing better features.
                                    
                                    CTO Statement -
                                    We have invested heavily in the current infrastructure, but much of the equipment is approaching the end of its useful life. We are consistently waiting weeks for new gear to be racked before we can start new projects. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.
                                    
                                    CFO Statement -
                                    Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years puts a cloud strategy between 30 to 50% lower than our current model.
                                    Question

                                    The current Dress4Win system architecture has high latency to some customers because it is located in one data center.
                                    As of a future evaluation and optimizing for performance in the cloud, Dresss4Win wants to distribute its system architecture to multiple locations when Google cloud platform.
                                    Which approach should they use?                                    
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A. Use regional managed instance groups and a global load balancer to increase performance because the regional managed instance group can grow instances in each region separately based on traffic.<br/> 
                                    B. Use a global load balancer with a set of virtual machines that forward the requests to a closer group of virtual machines managed by your operations team.<br/> 
                                    C. Use regional managed instance groups and a global load balancer to increase reliability by providing automatic failover between zones in different regions.<br/>
                                    D. Use a global load balancer with a set of virtual machines that forward the requests to a closer group of virtual machines as part of a separate managed instance groups.</p>

                                    Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and free them to focus on developing better features. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.
                                    Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years for a public cloud strategy achieves a cost reduction between 30% and 50% over our current model.
                                    Question
                                    For this question, refer to the Dress4Win case study. Dress4Win is expected to grow to 10 times its size in 1 year with a corresponding growth in data and traffic that mirrors the existing patterns of usage. The CIO has set the target of migrating production infrastructure to the cloud within the next 6 months. How will you configure the solution to scale for this growth without making major application changes and still maximize the ROI?

                                    Company Overview -
                                    Dress4Win is a web-based company that helps their users organize and manage their personal wardrobe using a web app and mobile application. The company also cultivates an active social network that connects their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through advertising, e-commerce, referrals, and a freemium app model. The application has grown from a few servers in the founder"™s garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a colocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insufficient for the application"™s rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company"™s desire to innovate faster, Dress4Win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud.

                                    Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and free them to focus on developing better features. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.
                                    Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years for a public cloud strategy achieves a cost reduction between 30% and 50% over our current model.
                                    Question
                                    For this question, refer to the Dress4Win case study. Which of the compute services should be migrated as-is and would still be an optimized architecture for performance in the cloud?

The company also cultivates an active social network that connects their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through advertising, e-commerce, referrals, and a freemium app model. The application has grown from a few servers in the founder"™s garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a colocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insufficient for the application"™s rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company"™s desire to innovate faster, Dress4Win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud.

                                    Improve security by defining and adhering to a set of security and Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices for cloud.
                                    Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources.
                                    Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud.
                                    
                                    Technical Requirements -
                                    Easily create non-production environments in the cloud.
                                    Implement an automation framework for provisioning resources in cloud.
                                    Implement a continuous deployment process for deploying applications to the on-premises datacenter or cloud.
                                    Support failover of the production environment to cloud during an emergency.
                                    Encrypt data on the wire and at rest.
                                    Support multiple private connections between the production data center and cloud environment.
                                    
                                    Executive Statement -
                                    Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and free them to focus on developing better features. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.
                                    Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years for a public cloud strategy achieves a cost reduction between 30% and 50% over our current model.
                                    Question
                                    For this question, refer to the Dress4Win case study. You want to ensure that your on-premises architecture meets business requirements before you migrate your solution.
                                    What change in the on-premises architecture should you make?
                                 </p>
