											<p>26. You are writing a single-page web application with a user-interface that communicates with a third-party API for content using XMLHttpRequest. The data displayed on the UI by the API results is less critical than other data displayed on the same web page, so it is acceptable for some requests to not have the API data displayed in the UI. However, calls made to the API should not delay rendering of other parts of the user interface. You want your application to perform well when the API response is an error or a timeout.

											<p>32. You are load testing your server application.

Your application is now receiving intermittent 5xx and 429 HTTP responses from the Cloud Storage
                                    JSON API as the demand escalates. You want to decrease the failed responses from the Cloud Storage API.
                                    What should you do?</p>
                                 <p>A. Distribute the uploads across a large number of individual storage buckets.<br/>

                                    We are the number one local community app; it's time to take our local community services global. Our venture capital investors want to see rapid growth and the same great experience for new local and virtual communities that come online, whether their members are 10 or 10000 miles away from each other.
                                    
                                    Solution Concept -
                                    HipLocal wants to expand their existing service, with updated functionality, in new regions to better serve their global customers. They want to hire and train a new team to support these regions in their time zones. They will need to ensure that the application scales smoothly and provides clear uptime data.
                                    
                                    Existing Technical Environment -
                                    HipLocal's environment is a mix of on-premises hardware and infrastructure running in Google Cloud Platform. The HipLocal team understands their application well, but has limited experience in global scale applications. Their existing technical environment is as follows:
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>Existing APIs run on Compute Engine virtual machine instances hosted in GCP.</li>
                                       <li>State is stored in a single instance MySQL database in GCP.</li>
                                       <li>Data is exported to an on-premises Teradata/Vertica data warehouse.</li>
                                       <li>Data analytics is performed in an on-premises Hadoop environment.</li>
                                       <li>The application has no logging.</li>
                                       <li>There are basic indicators of uptime; alerts are frequently fired when the APIs are unresponsive.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    Business Requirements -
                                    HipLocal's investors want to expand their footprint and support the increase in demand they are seeing. Their requirements are:
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>Expand availability of the application to new regions.</li>
                                       <li>Increase the number of concurrent users that can be supported.</li>
                                       <li>Ensure a consistent experience for users when they travel to different regions.</li>
                                       <li>Obtain user activity metrics to better understand how to monetize their product.</li>
                                       <li>Ensure compliance with regulations in the new regions (for example, GDPR).</li>
                                       <li>Reduce infrastructure management time and cost.</li>
                                       <li>Adopt the Google-recommended practices for cloud computing.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    Technical Requirements -
                                    <ul>
                                       <li>The application and backend must provide usage metrics and monitoring.</li>
                                       <li>APIs require strong authentication and authorization.</li>
                                       <li>Logging must be increased, and data should be stored in a cloud analytics platform.</li>
                                       <li>Move to serverless architecture to facilitate elastic scaling.</li>
                                       <li>Provide authorized access to internal apps in a secure manner.</li>
                                       <li>HipLocal wants to improve the resilience of their MySQL deployment, while also meeting their business and technical requirements.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    Which configuration should they choose?</p>
                                 <p>A. Use the current single instance MySQL on Compute Engine and several read-only MySQL servers on Compute Engine.<br/> 
                                    B. Use the current single instance MySQL on Compute Engine, and replicate the data to Cloud SQL in an external master configuration.<br/> 
                                    C. Replace the current single instance MySQL instance with Cloud SQL, and configure high availability.<br/>
                                    D. Replace the current single instance MySQL instance with Cloud SQL, and Google provides redundancy without further configuration.</p>
