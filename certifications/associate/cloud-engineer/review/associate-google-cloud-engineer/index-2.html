                                            <p>8. You have an application running in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with cluster autoscaling enabled. The application exposes a TCP endpoint. There are several replicas of this application. You have a Compute Engine instance in the same region, but in another Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), called gce-network, that has no overlapping IP ranges with the first VPC. This instance needs to connect to the application on GKE. You want to minimize effort. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type LoadBalancer that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2.

                                               B. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type NodePort that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2. Create a Compute Engine instance called proxy with 2 network interfaces, one in each VPC. 3. Use iptables on this instance to forward traffic from gce-network to the GKE nodes. 4. Configure the Compute Engine instance to use the address of proxy in gce-network as endpoint.<br/> 
                                               C. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type LoadBalancer that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2. Add an annotation to this service: cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: Internal 3. Peer the two VPCs together. 4. Configure the Compute Engine instance to use the address of the load balancer that has been created.<br/> 
                                               D. 1. In GKE, create a Service of type LoadBalancer that uses the application's Pods as backend. 2. Add a Cloud Armor Security Policy to the load balancer that whitelists the internal IPs of the MIG's instances. 3. Configure the Compute Engine instance to use the address of the load balancer that has been created.</p>

However, security policies prevent the servers hosting the application from having public IP addresses or access to the internet. You want to follow Google-recommended practices to provide the application with access to Cloud Storage. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. 1. Use nslookup to get the IP address for storage.googleapis.com. 2. Negotiate with the security team to be able to give a public IP address to the servers. 3. Only allow egress traffic from those servers to the IP addresses for storage.googleapis.com.<br/>

You have already installed the Cloud Logging agent on all the instances. You want to minimize cost. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. 1. Give the BigQuery Data Editor role on the platform-logs dataset to the service accounts used by your instances. 2. Update your instances metadata to add the following value: logs-destination: bq://platform-logs.<br/>
                                               B. 1. In Cloud Logging, create a logs export with a Cloud Pub/Sub topic called logs as a sink. 2. Create a Cloud Function that is triggered by messages in the logs topic. 3. Configure that Cloud Function to drop logs that are not from Compute Engine and to insert Compute Engine logs in the platform-logs dataset.<br/>
                                               C. 1. In Cloud Logging, create a filter to view only Compute Engine logs. 2. Click Create Export. 3. Choose BigQuery as Sink Service, and the platform-logs dataset as Sink Destination.<br/> 
                                               D. 1. Create a Cloud Function that has the BigQuery User role on the platform-logs dataset. 2. Configure this Cloud Function to create a BigQuery Job that executes this query: INSERT INTO dataset.platform-logs (timestamp, log) SELECT timestamp, log FROM compute.logs WHERE timestamp > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY) 3. Use Cloud Scheduler to trigger this Cloud Function once a day.</p>

                                            <p>18. You are using Deployment Manager to create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster. Using the same Deployment Manager deployment, you also want to create a
                                             DaemonSet in the kube-system namespace of the cluster. You want a solution that uses the fewest possible services. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. Add the cluster API as a new Type Provider in Deployment Manager, and use the new type to create the DaemonSet.<br/>
                                               B. Use the Deployment Manager Runtime Configurator to create a new Config resource that contains the DaemonSet definition.<br/>
                                               C. With Deployment Manager, create a Compute Engine instance with a startup script that uses kubectl to create the DaemonSet.<br/>
                                               D. In the cluster definition in Deployment Manager, add a metadata that has kube-system as key and the DaemonSet manifest as value.</p>

You created a service account that has appropriate access to AutoML. You need to enable authentication to the APIs from your on-premises environment. What should you do?</p>
                                            <p>A. Use service account credentials in your on-premises application.<br/>
                                               B. Use gcloud to create a key file for the service account that has appropriate permissions.<br/> 
                                               C. Set up direct interconnect between your data center and Google Cloud Platform to enable authentication for your on-premises applications.<br/> 
                                               D. Go to the IAM & admin console, grant a user account permissions similar to the service account permissions, and use this user account for authentication from your data center.</p>

                                            <p>A. In the project where the images are stored, grant the Storage Object Viewer IAM role to the service account used by the Kubernetes nodes.<br/> 
                                               B. When you create the GKE cluster, choose the Allow full access to all Cloud APIs option under Access scopes.<br/>
