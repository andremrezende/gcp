											<p>143. Your company is designing its data lake on Google Cloud and wants to develop different ingestion pipelines to collect unstructured data from different sources.
                                    After the data is stored in Google Cloud, it will be processed in several data pipelines to build a recommendation engine for end users on the website. The structure of the data retrieved from the source systems can change at any time. The data must be stored exactly as it was retrieved for reprocessing purposes in case the data structure is
                                     incompatible with the current processing pipelines. You need to design an architecture to support the use case after you retrieve the data. What should you do?</p>
                                 <p>A. Send the data through the processing pipeline, and then store the processed data in a BigQuery table for reprocessing.<br/> 
                                    B. Store the data in a BigQuery table. Design the processing pipelines to retrieve the data from the table.<br/> 
                                    C. Send the data through the processing pipeline, and then store the processed data in a Cloud Storage bucket for reprocessing.<br/>
                                    D. Store the data in a Cloud Storage bucket. Design the processing pipelines to retrieve the data from the bucket.</p>
